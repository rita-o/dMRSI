# dMRI-dMRS Processing Toolbox

This python toolbox is intended for researchers working with advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI), in particular *multi-shell* and *multi–diffusion-time* acquisitions; and diffusion MRS (dMRS) data with multi–diffusion-time and multi–b-value acquired with the *SPECIAL* sequence, on Bruker or Siemens scanners.

It provides **preprocessing and analysis pipelines** for both modalities:

  🔵 **Diffusion MRI (dMRI)**: detailed documentation for the dMRI processing pipeline is available [here](README_dMRI.md).  
  🟡 **Diffusion MRS (dMRS)**: detailed documentation for the dMRS processing pipeline is available [here](README_dMRS.md).  

> 🛠️ **This toolbox is a continuous work in progress.**

## 🚀 Quick Start  

1. Install the repository and required software as described below.
2. Prepare the cohort Excel file (see `common/example_study.xlsx`). (⚠️ Note the change of columns names in the cohort file in Dec/2025).
3. Put raw data from the scanner under:
     <pre>
   folder_study_name (name of your project's folder)
       └── raw_data  
         └── raw_data_folder (name of the folder created in the MRI scanner)
      </pre>
4. (Optional!)  
   For ROI-based analysis of dMRI data, prepare an atlas and/or tissue probability map (TPM) and save it in `common/atlas` (see notes [here](README_dMRI.md)).
5. Choose the appropriate processing script (inside folder `scripts`):  

   🔵 For **dMRI processing**:
      - **Main_rat.py** — For rodent dMRI data  
      - **Main_organoid.py** — For organoid dMRI data   
   
   🟡 For **dMRS processing**:
      - **Main.py** — For rodent dMRI data  
8. Edit the configuration structure `cfg` at the start of each script to customize the parameters for the analysis.
9. Run individual steps (e.g., `StepX`) (recommended) or the full pipeline.

## 📌 Notes

### 1. Dataset Metadata

Each dataset must include an Excel file with **cohort metadata** (e.g., subject ID, group, scan date).  
Some columns will be automatically filled during Step1 of the pipeline.  
An example file is provided in the `common` folder.The following columns must be pre-filled manually before running the script:
  
> - **study_name**: Assigned study name (e.g., `sub-01`, `sub-02`, …)  
> - **raw_data_folder**: Name of the raw data folder saved in the MRI system  
>   &nbsp;  • Must match the folder containing this subject’s raw data  
>   &nbsp;  • Should match the name used in the methods file
> - **other_name_tag**: (optional) Other name tag, like the rat number or batch...
> - **sex**: (optional) Sex of the subject (`F` or `M`) 
> - **group**: (optional) Group tag (e.g.,`1` or `2`, or `WT`, `disease`) 
> - **scanNo**: Folder number of raw imaging data (integer)  
> - **acqType**: Acquisition type (`T2W`, `PGSE`, `STE`, `SPECIAL`); pay attention to capital letters. 
> - **sessNo**: Session number (usually `1`, unless it’s a rescan)  
> - **Reorient**: Outdated, please leave blanck
>   &nbsp;      This standard orientation allows easier integration with online atlases and tools. *(Required for dMRI data; not required for dMRS.)*
> - **VoxMidHem**: voxel of the mid coronal plane in dwi space to then define left and right hemispheres. If you don't know or don't care set it to zero and ignore the results of the dMRI metrics plots left and right. *(Required for dMRI data; not required for dMRS.)*
> - **anat_thr**: intensity threshold to be used as initial guess for the creation of an anatomical brain mask for dMRI processing. *(Required for dMRI data; not required for dMRS.)*
> - **Notes**: Notes regarding that specidic subejct/acquisition.
> - **analyse**: 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no) if that row of data is to be analyzed or not (for example if there are repeated/bad scans put that column to 'y' only on the one you want to keep).
> - **TM**: For dMRS analysis only! Mixing time in ms.
> - **dMRS_acq_type**: For dMRS analysis only! Options are: 'water' or 'metab', if the data was acquired for water or metabolites, respectively. 
> - **coil_type**: For dMRS analysis only! Options are: 'rat' for animals scanned with rat cryo prob; or 'mouse' for animals scanned with mouse cryo probe

### 2. `common/` Folder

The `common` folder contains **shared resources** required across multiple processing pipelines:

- Pre-configured **Anaconda environments** 
- Example **ScanList_example.xlsx**
- dMRI: **STE sequence b-values and b-vecs**, which cannot be retrieved from the methods file  
  (plus placeholder/fake b-vectors needed for parts of the analysis)
- dMRI: **Atlas folders** for ROI-based analysis of dMRI data ([see read me](README_dMRI.md)). Atlases used: Rodents: *WHS_v4*; Humans: *DKT*, *Juelich*. ⚠️ Atlas folders are too large for GitHub. Please **contact us** if you need access to what we usually use.
- dMRI: **.cnf topup files** with parameter details for topup analysis of dMRI data.
- dMRS: **mrs_basis_sets**: basis datasets for dMRS quantification

### 3. Common Python Scripts

Several Python modules support multiple components of the pipeline:

- **`auxiliar_modelling.py`**  
  Auxiliary functions for modeling routines (e.g., fitting options such as `nexi`).

- **`bids_structure.py`**  
  Utilities for organizing data in **BIDS** format.

- **`custom_functions.py`**  
  General-purpose helper functions used throughout the pipeline.

- **`atlas_functions.py`**  
  Atlas-specific utilities: preparing and resampling atlases; parsing atlas label files; mapping ROI names to atlas region IDs. When adding a **new atlas**, this module must be updated accordingly.

## 🛠️ SOFTWARE INSTALLATION

To run this toolbox, you need to install the following:

### 1. Neuroimaging tools

The following external tools must be installed on your system.
Although they can be added to your system `PATH` and called directly from the command line, this is not required for this pipeline. 
Instead, their installation paths must be specified in the configuration file used by the main processing script.

- [**FSL (FMRIB Software Library)**](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/) Needed throughout preprocessing. Need for dMRI data analysis.
- [**ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools)**](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) Needed throughout preprocessing. Need for dMRI data analysis. 
- [**MRtrix3**](https://www.mrtrix.org/) Need for dMRI data analysis.
- [**DESIGNER**](https://nyu-diffusionmri.github.io/DESIGNER-v2/) v2.0.13. Needed for denoising and DTI/DKI fitting. Need for dMRI data analysis.
- [**RATS_MM**](https://iibi.uiowa.edu/rats-rodent-brain-mri) Need only for brain extraction of rodent data if this option is chosen (available options: RATS, UNET). Need for dMRI data analysis.
- [**LCModel**](https://s-provencher.com/lcmodel.shtml) Needed for dMRS metabolite quantification. 


### 2. Conda and several environments

This pipeline uses multiple tools that require different software versions.  
To avoid conflicts, each tool is installed in its own *Conda environment*, with the main one being `pipeline`.

- **Step 1** – Install one of the following environment management systems: Anaconda, Miniconda, Mamba, Micromamba  
- **Step 2** – Install the need environments by doing:

```bash
cd ./common/_envs
chmod +x install_envs.sh
bash install_envs.sh
```
This will install all these environments:

- **pipeline** Environment name: `pipeline`; Purpose: Main environment to run this script. Activate this conda environment to run this analysis.
- [**Dicomifier**](https://github.com/lamyj/dicomifier) Environment name: `Dicomifier`; Purpose: Conversion of Bruker data to NIfTI. Only needed for dMRI data acquired with Bruker scanner - on rodents or organoids for example.
- [**SwissKnife**](https://github.com/rita-o/graymatter_swissknife) Environment name: `SwissKnife`; Purpose: Apply microstructural models to the dMRI data. Needed to apply NEXI, SANDI or SMEX on dMRI data.
   [**uGUIDE**](https://github.com/rita-o/uGUIDE) Environment name: `uGUIDE`; Purpose: Apply microstructural models to the dMRI data with a Bayesian framework from Maëliss Jallais and Marco Palombo. Needed to apply NEXI_uGUIDE on dMRI data.
- [**ANTS**](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy) Environment name: `ants`; Purpose: python interface to ANTs. Note: although ANTs is installed and accessible from the command line, this Conda environment provides the Python API and additional utilities required for generating a NIfTI representation of the MRS voxel when dMRS data are present.
- [**RodentSkullStrip UNET**](https://github.com/CAMRIatUNC/RodentMRISkullStripping) Environment name: `RodentSkullStrip`; Purpose: skull strip of rodent data with U-NET. Need only for brain extraction of rodent data if this option is chosen (available options: RATS, UNET)

### 3. MATLAB runtime

The dMRS processing codes are provided as *compiled MATLAB executables*.  
To run them, you **do not need a MATLAB license**, but you must install the MATLAB Runtime (R2025a)(⚠️ you need this specific runtime version): https://ch.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

🔸EXTRA🔸 A proper full **MATLAB** license is required if:  
  **3.1.** Using the MATLAB-based denoising options, with the [**MPPCA**](https://github.com/Neurophysics-CFIN/MP-PCA-Denoising) and [**tMPPCA**](https://github.com/Neurophysics-CFIN/Tensor-MP-PCA) toolboxes. These toolboxes should be downloaded and placed in a directory that is specified in the main script configuration (cfg['toolboxes']). If MATLAB is not available, denoising can instead be performed using **MRtrix** or **DESIGNER** (see `Step3.py`).  
  
  **3.2.** Using SANDI matlab implementation of Marco Palombo [**SANDI**](https://github.com/palombom/SANDI-Matlab-Toolbox-Latest-Release). This toolbox should be downloaded and placed in a directory that is specified in the main script configuration (cfg['toolboxes']).
  
  (**3.3**. The pipeline previously also relied on [**md-dmri-master**](https://github.com/markus-nilsson/md-dmri/tree/master) and [**SPM12**](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) to compute *microscopic FA (µFA)* when *STE* data were acquired. These dependencies are now commented out in the scripts, as a *Python implementation of the µFA computation* has been integrated.)

### 4. Install the Toolbox

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd dMRI_dMRS_toolbox
```
Activate your pipeline environment: 
```
conda activate pipeline
```
Install the toolbox: 
```
pip install -e .
```

Now you're ready to use it 🎉  
Open Python and start working.
