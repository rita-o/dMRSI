"""
Main script to preprocess and analyze diffusion MRI (dMRI) data acquired on RODENTS.

Current parameters are configured for Bruker rodent dMRI data by default.

The pipeline supports multi-shell acquisitions with multiple diffusion times,
including Linear Tensor Encoding (LTE) and Spherical Tensor Encoding (STE),
together with an anatomical reference image (T1- or T2-weighted).

## USAGE SUMMARY

- Prepare the cohort Excel file (see common/example_study.xlsx).

- Place raw scanner data under:
      folder_study_name/raw_data/studyName_X/

- Edit the cfg section at the top of the script before running with the 
  desired processing parameters.

- Run individual steps (StepX) to inspect outputs (recommended),
  or run the full pipeline (not recommmended).
  

## RODENT-SPECIFIC NOTES

- Orientation correction (Step2_correct_orientation) is required for Bruker data 
  to match standard atlas orientations (not necessary if a different atlas is 
  used or if no atlas-based analysis is needed or if you don't want).
  This step is handled during preprocessing based on the
  metadata provided in the cohort Excel file.

- ROI-based analyses require a suitable atlas to be prepared in advance.
  A standard atlas must include:
    * an anatomical template image (`*template_brain*`)
    * an atlas image with integer region labels (`*atlas*`)
    * a label file mapping region IDs to region names (`*label*`)

  If a TPM (tissue probability map) atlas is used, it must include:
    * an anatomical template image (`*template_brain*`)
    * a TPM image containing tissue probability maps (`*TPM*`)

  These files are used during registration and ROI-based parameter extraction
  (Step3_registrations and Step5_get_estimates). Please refer to
  `atlas_functions.py` to prepare the atlas before running the analysis.

########################## DATA PROCESSING ##########################

#### STEP 1. COHORT DEFINITION ####
Step1_fill_study_excel(cfg)    

#### STEP 2. NIFTI CONVERT SUBJECT  ####

# 2.1 Use Dicomifier to convert to nifi (pass as argument the datapath to load the cfg file)
Step2_raw2nii2bids(cfg)    
           
# 2.2 Correct orientation from bruker system to be consisten with normal atlas and everything else
Step2_correct_orientation(cfg)  

#### STEP 3. PREPROCESS SUBJECT ####

# 3.1 Process normal linear encoding data with PSGE (LTE), along with anatomical image
Step3_preproc(cfg) 

# 3.2 Process spherical encoding (STE) data, assumes an anatomical image has already been processed before
# Only needed if STE data is present
Step3_preproc_STE(cfg) 

# 3.3 Register atlas to anatomical image and then to dwi for individual or combined diffusion times. 
# If exists also fits STE to LTE. Does not register across sessions for now. 
# Takes a long time. Comment out if no regional estimations are needed
Step3_registrations(cfg)

#### STEP 4. MODELLING SUBJECT ####

# Fit the dwi signal with models like Nexi, Sandi, SMI, ....
# Diffusion Tensor (DTI) and Kurtusis (DKI) is always done by default. 
# To be faster and perform only DTI and DKI fitting just leave cfg['model_list_GM'] 
# and cfg['model_list_WM'] empty.
Step4_modelling(cfg)

#### STEP 5. GET VALUES ####

# Retreives parameter estimates from the model fits, making summary figures and excel with data in certain ROIs
# Needs the registration step 3 to be done before. Comment out if no regional estimations are needed
Step5_get_estimates(cfg)
